Arduino library for backlight control of Truly LCD front panel from
Sercomm SHG1500 modem/router. Truly LCD is used on hardware version LCDv6.

Usage scenario:

At the beggining of program:
	TrulyBacklight bl;

In setup():
	bl.setControlPin(pin);

Anywhere in code:
	bl.reset();
	bl.setIntensity(0x10);
	bl.setOnOff(HIGH);
	bl.setOnOff(LOW);

Intensity level is a number between 0 and 31.
After bl.reset() it turns on at maximum intensity if you don't call immediately
bl.setIntensity(). Turning on and off the backlight does not reset the intensity
value unless you change it with bl.setIntensity() or call bl.reset(). After
bl.setIntensity() is called backlight turns on with selected intensity value.
